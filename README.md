# Servo-LED-CMRI-Master

A lot of the code was taken from Rob on Little Wicket Railway's YouTube channel.  I combined several of his videos and code and some of my own into this one.

Separate PCA boards are needed to drive servos and LEDs.  This is to reduce jitter and twitching on servos when not in use.
See comments in the code itself.
